- Removed blog links.

- Added hover states for header and footer elements.

- Created a public folder for the header/footer CSS and JavaScript file.
When using the CSS file, please ensure it is the first CSS file in the head element so that conflicting styles can be overriden by the next CSS files. Samad and Abiola, please check out the description.txt for a guide on how to implement the header and footer changes.

- Implemented figma changes.

- I'm still working on the 404 folder and delivery-method folder, I will push as soon as possible. Nothing should be done on it yet.
